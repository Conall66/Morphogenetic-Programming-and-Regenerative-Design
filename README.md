# Project Outline

- Investigate the application of DeepQ RL in the design of resilient water distribution networks
- Adjust the discount factor to demonstrate system adaptation for long term vs short term optimisation
- Compare computational expense, Shannon-Entropy-Cost ratio with conventional GA algorithms
