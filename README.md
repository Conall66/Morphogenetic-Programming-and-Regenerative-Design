# Project Outline

- Aiming to investigate the potential advantages and drawbacks for different functional, structural plant modelling (FSPM) softwares
  built on reinforcement learning, machine learning with point cloud generation, or L-system models
- Building reliable models to model plant growths in deisgning reliable bio-materials, accounting for uncertainty in randomness
- Attempting to contextualise plant growths by providing environmental conditions, with the aim of possible BIM integration package output

The broader aim of this project is to facilitate the uptake of regenerative design in urban landscapes, building a carbon negative future
