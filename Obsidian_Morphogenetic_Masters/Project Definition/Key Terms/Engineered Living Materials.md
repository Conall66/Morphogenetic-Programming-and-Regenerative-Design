Engineered living materials (ELMs) possess unique functionalities compared with traditional building materials. Among novel functionalities are **bioremediation** (the ability to break down, change, remove, immobilize or detoxify various physical and chemical pollutants), **self-healing** (the built-in ability to automatically repair damages to themselves), **antioxidant** (the capability to inhibit the production of free radicals), **self-replication** (the capacity to build an identical or similar copy of itself), **resilience** (the quick ability to recover from damage), **signalling** (the ability to receive, process and transmit signals with its environment and within itself), **sensing** (the ability to perceive and react to various signals), **remodelling** (the capacity to change or alter the structure, style or form), **self-regulation** (the ability to monitor and manage certain properties without intervention from external bodies) and **evolvability** (the capacity of adaptive evolution).
