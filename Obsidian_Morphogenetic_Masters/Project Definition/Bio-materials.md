Within The Green Guide to Specification (4th edition), biomaterials are classed as **naturally-derived construction materials (ie those originating from plant or animal sources) providing both structural and non-structural functions within the building fabric** [The construction wiki](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Biomaterial)

| Advantages                       | Disadvantages           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Fully biodegradable              | Durability              |
| Carbon sequestration             | High development costs  |
| Sustainability                   | Lack of standardisation |
| Air quality                      | Regulatory restrictions |
| Thermal performance              | Limited awareness       |
| Optimised biological processes   |                         |
| Lower risk of allergic reactions |                         |
## Living Bio-Materials

- Useful in self-healing (i.e. healthcare applications)
- Environmental response (temperature, air pressure, pH)
- Bio-remediation (building living ecosystems in and around areas of harmful contaminants can can allow for their absorption, plus the uptake of precious metals etc.)
- Energy production
- Carbon sequestration
