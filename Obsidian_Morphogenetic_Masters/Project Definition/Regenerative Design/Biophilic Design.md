[What is and is not biophilic design](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/what-is-and-is-not-biophilic-design/) 

- Focuses on the components of the natural world that are attributed to **providing health and productivity benefits** (typically not coral or desert life for example)
- Focus on the interconnected nature of an environment - showing a **clear consideration for the total environmental impact** (the ecosystem 'performs' better as part of a collective)
- Must be **continually connected to natural world**
- Fosters sustained **emotional connections with the space**
