Biophilic design seeks to connect our inherent need to affiliate with nature in the modern built environment [What is and is not biophilic design](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/what-is-and-is-not-biophilic-design/) \[...] the fundamental goal of biophilic design is to create good habitat for people as biological organisms inhabiting modern structures, landscapes, and communities.
## Rules of Biophilic Design
[What is and is not biophilic design](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/what-is-and-is-not-biophilic-design/) 

- Focuses on the components of the natural world that are attributed to **providing health and productivity benefits** (typically not coral or desert life for example)
- Focus on the interconnected nature of an environment - showing a **clear consideration for the total environmental impact** (the ecosystem 'performs' better as part of a collective)
- Must be **continually connected to natural world**
- Fosters sustained **emotional connections with the space**
## Applications

### Direct Experience of Nature
Spaces that allow direct experience of Light, Air, Water, Plants, Animals, Weather, and Natural Landscapes and Ecosystems
#### Examples
- Hoge Veluwe pavilion in the Netherlands
- SFER IK art centre in Tulum, Mexico
### Indirect Experience of Nature
Nature represented by these elements: Images of Nature, Natural Materials, Natural Colours, Mobility and Wayfinding, Cultural and, Ecological Attachment to Place, Simulating Natural Light and Air, Naturalistic Shapes and Forms, Evoking Nature, Information Richness, Natural Geometries, Biomimicry, and Age, Change, and the Patina of Time
### Experience of Space and Place
Biophilia can also be achieved through these approaches: Prospect and Refuge, Organized Complexity, Integration of Parts to Wholes, and Transitional Spaces
