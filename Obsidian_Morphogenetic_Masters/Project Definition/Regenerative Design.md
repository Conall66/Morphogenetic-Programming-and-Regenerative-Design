## What is Regenerative Design?

- "Regenerative design is an approach in which human and natural systems are designed to co-exist and co-evolve over time" [Arup](https://www.arup.com/insights/what-is-regenerative-design/)
### Aims

- Carbon negative design
- Integrate existing landscapes
- Work alongside wildlife and plant life
- Re-establish water cycles  [Arup](https://www.arup.com/insights/what-is-regenerative-design/)
- Positive ventilations schemes
- Preventing harmful toxins leaking into environment
- Bio-degradability of natural components
- Green energy
## Why is it Important?
- "The value of a regenerative design approach is in its potential to regenerate planetary health and deliver positive outcomes for both people and planet" [Arup](https://www.arup.com/insights/what-is-regenerative-design/)
## Where is it being done?
### Case Studies

**[Habitat Royale](https://kondorwessels.nl/en/portfolio/habitat-royale/)**:
- Designed on a "nature first" concept
- Plant life is given space to grow
- Consists of 94 homes
- Carbon negative
## Where did it come from?
## What are some of the problems?

### Integrating Living Biology

## Architectural Approaches

- **Rammed Earth**: Ramming a mixture of selected aggregates, including gravel, sand, silt, and a small amount of clay, into place between flat panels called formwork.
	- Low embodied energy
	- Natural resources can be naturally recycled
	- High thermal mass for insulative properties
