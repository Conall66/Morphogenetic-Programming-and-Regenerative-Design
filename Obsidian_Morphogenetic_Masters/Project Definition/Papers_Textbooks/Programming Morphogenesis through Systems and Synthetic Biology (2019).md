This paper explores the possibility of using morphogenetic programming models to explain tissue growth/repair mechanisms for stem cell biology

## Key Points

- Current _in vitro_ **morphogenesis** models frequently lack spatiotemporal control, robustness, and reproducibility that are exhibited _in vivo_ by natural biological systems such as developing organs
