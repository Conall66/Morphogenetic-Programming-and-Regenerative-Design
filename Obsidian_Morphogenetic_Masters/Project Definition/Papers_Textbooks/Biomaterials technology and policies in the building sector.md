[Biomaterials technology and policies in the building sector](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-023-01689-w)
## Paper Outline
This paper summarises the applications of different bio-materials in the construction industry, considering UK policy, performance, durability, regulation etc.
### Key Points

- "A significant hurdle lies in the commercial viability of biomaterials, as some presently entail higher production costs than traditional materials, posing a challenge in terms of market competitiveness. To overcome this, **efforts are needed to optimize production processes and reduce costs while maintaining biomaterials' environmental benefits and performance**."
- "Biomaterials hold the potential to revolutionize the construction industry, offering ecologically sustainable and efficacious substances"
- Research case studies have shown the potential to sound proof buildings, prevent heat loss, resist water damages and chemicals


- Evaluation of key bio materials:
![[Table Benefits and Challenges Biomaterials.png | 400]]
	- Bioplastics have high production costs
	- Bio-composites struggle to meet industry performance standards
	- Bio-cement and geopolymers **can't ensure consistency**
	- Mycelial materials can't be easily scaled (slow grow rate)
	- Cellulose materials **can't meet regulatory requirements**
