## Paper Outline
This paper summarises the applications of different bio-materials in the construction industry, considering UK policy, performance, durability, regulation etc.
### Key Points

- "A significant hurdle lies in the commercial viability of biomaterials, as some presently entail higher production costs than traditional materials, posing a challenge in terms of market competitiveness. To overcome this, **efforts are needed to optimize production processes and reduce costs while maintaining biomaterials' environmental benefits and performance**."
