## Question Topics

- Introduction of project stage
- Ask about Anna's work with ACC
- Pathways to Transformative Adaptation of South African Cities
	- Possibility of creating agent based models to demonstrate the potential gains of TA (optimisation)
	- How complex are these systems? How easy would it be to model?
	- How are these cities adapting at the moment and why is it unsustainable?
	- How is climate change affecting these cities? Where is it affecting most heavily?
	- Does there exist information on the growth of existing water infrastructure for example? If not, how useful would a toy model be, taking synthetic cities to demonstrate potential growth patterns?
	- How do communities interact with one another?
	- Would it be useful to highlight the most important infrastructure points, now and in the future? (Markov Chains)
	- Would it be valuable to demonstrate why institutions should work together (possibility for Shapley values/game theory use in pricing models)
- Would it be better to design models informing general city development measures informed by TA (i.e. )
