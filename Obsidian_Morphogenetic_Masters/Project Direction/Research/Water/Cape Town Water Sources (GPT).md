### Main Water Sources for Cape Town

1. **Theewaterskloof Dam** – The largest dam, providing about **50% of Cape Town's water supply**.
2. **Berg River Dam** – A major contributor to the system.
3. **Wemmershoek Dam** – Supplies part of the city's demand.
4. **Voëlvlei Dam** – Another significant source.
5. **Steenbras Upper & Lower Dams** – Supplementary sources that also support hydroelectric power generation.

### Additional Water Sources

- **Groundwater**: The city has started tapping into the **Table Mountain Group Aquifer**, Cape Flats Aquifer, and Atlantis Aquifer to supplement surface water.
- **Desalination**: Small-scale desalination plants were introduced during the **Day Zero crisis** (2017–2018) to provide limited amounts of freshwater.
- **Reclaimed Water**: Wastewater treatment and reuse have been explored to help reduce reliance on dam water.

### Challenges & Future Strategies

- Cape Town is vulnerable to **droughts**, such as the severe **2015–2018 water crisis**.
- The city is investing in **alternative water sources**, including expanding groundwater extraction, improving wastewater recycling, and considering larger-scale desalination.
