In partnership with the African Centre for Cities? Model how cities/settlements grow around key water infrastructure using agent based modelling, and how continued growth will only increase scarcity without intervention. Then model how transformative adaptation can increase water security, but also further trust and create jobs for a struggling economy.
## Existing Research

- By 2030, urban water demand in South Africa is projected to exceed supply by 17% (2.7 billion m3), rising to 3.8 billion m3 when accounting for climate change impacts [Water Scarcity and Alternative Water Sources in Africa](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1573062X.2022.2026984)
- South African people are migrating to larger cities that already face water stress

## Data Availability

**Data Form Options**:
1. Spaciotemporal data ([[GIS]])
2. Existing datasets - food networks, water networks etc.
3. Synthetic data - simulate city growth information with guidance from [[African Centre of Cities (ACC)]]
## Key Assumptions

1. Climate change has a significant effects on how cities and settlements evolve in South Africa
2. Climate change will continue to have a worsening impact on how cities and settlements evolve in South Africa
