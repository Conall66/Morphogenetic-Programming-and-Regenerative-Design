In partnership with the African Centre for Cities? Model how cities/settlements grow around key water infrastructure using agent based modelling, and how continued growth will only increase scarcity and disease without intervention. This can drive economic and political instability and worsen public health. Then model how infrastructure development can increase water security, targeting regions most at risk, but also further trust and create jobs. Maybe show how smaller, quicker developments improve public trust before integrating into a wider system.
## Problem Statement

Predictions state that by 2050, 1.5 billion people will live in African cities: more than double the current figure. Water demand in South Africa
## Existing Research

- By 2030, urban water demand in South Africa is projected to exceed supply by 17% (2.7 billion m3), rising to 3.8 billion m3 when accounting for climate change impacts [Water Scarcity and Alternative Water Sources in Africa](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1573062X.2022.2026984)
- South African people are migrating to larger cities that already face water stress

- South Africa is experiencing rapid urbanization, with projections indicating that 1.5 billion people will live in African cities by 2050, **more than double the current number** [As Cities Grow Across Africa, They Must Plan for Water Security](https://www.wri.org/insights/cities-grow-across-africa-they-must-plan-water-security)
- City leaders are also closest to where water insecurity hits hardest: the poor and vulnerable communities who make up **more than half** of the urban population. In short, African cities are at a unique moment: **they can succumb to chaotic, unplanned expansion and outmoded water management or chart a more sustainable approach that lays a foundation for prosperity by â€œgetting water right.**
- Nearly 63% of urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa lack access to basic water and sanitation
- <b><u>To increase water resilience, we need to change how cities are being built. Cities should be planned to meet water needs, using approaches that extend beyond the city limits and consider systems change throughout entire city-regions</u></b>
- First, urban planning and management experts need to be informed of the risks to the natural water cycle and flow regimes, **placing the right incentives and regulations to manage city expansion**
![[Service Gap Between Water and Urban Pops.png]]
- Many South African cities are expanding outward into watersheds and cropland, depleting water resources and natural assets in the periphery
- In 2018, the African Development Bank found that the continent needs to spend at least $66 billion to address water infrastructure failures
- The Global Commission of Adaptation report states that this event **could create cost-benefit ratios between 2:1 and 10:1**
- Investment is currently tailored towards siloed sectoral needs - **we need greater consideration for long term environmental resilience**

### Adaptation Principles

[World Resources Institute Adaptation Principles](https://www.wri.org/events/2020/12/adaptation-principles-new-approaches-building-resilience)
1. Inclusivity
2. Preparedness
3. Focus on critical infrastructure vs land use
4. Quick recovery/adaptability/flexibility
5. Consider wider implications
6. Monitor
### Impact of Water Insecurity on Health

### Growth Rules

- Avoid green areas that are vital for flood mitigation and water purification (i.e. wetlands)
- Better stormwater drainage
- Water supply and management must adapt to constrained resources
### Approaches Towards Greater Water Security

- Water supply may be managed by the water utility, source water management may sit within national agencies, while management of water assets may sit with the environmental authorities. **Greater integration and coordination across agencies is essential**, and city leaders can harness new ways of working, bringing together actors vertically and horizontally, building local partnerships within cities and fostering integrated solutions across the entire watershed region [As Cities Grow Across Africa, They Must Plan for Water Security](https://www.wri.org/insights/cities-grow-across-africa-they-must-plan-water-security)

## Data Availability

**Data Form Options**:
1. Spaciotemporal data ([[GIS]])
2. Existing datasets - food networks, water networks etc.
3. Synthetic data - simulate city growth information with guidance from [[African Centre of Cities (ACC)]]
### Useful Databases

- [Slum Dwellers International Data Portal](https://sdinet.org/explore-our-data/country/?country=south-africa) - database has fragmented information on prioritised development needs, water availability and most common diseases by slums across South Africa and other developing countries
- [Major Infrastructure SA Time Series](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/world-bank-infrastructure-indicators-for-south-africa) - shows for the whole of SA how much investment into different types of infrastructure (telecommunications, transport, freshwater resources)
- [Open Source SA Toolkit](https://opendataza.gitbook.io/toolkit/open-data-resources/water-and-climate-data-resources) - seems to be open data sets on spatial land and infrastructure use as well as water and climate information
- [Access to Water by Municipalities Time Series](https://www.dws.gov.za/niwis2/Sanitation/AccessToServices) - Information on access to sanitised water backlog on population by municipality over time (can use population information to show rate of migration towards urban environments)
- [Urbanisation Over Time SA - Office for National Statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226106/urbanization-rate-in-africa/)

## Key Assumptions

1. Climate change has a significant effects on how cities and settlements evolve in South Africa
2. Climate change will continue to have a worsening impact on how cities and settlements evolve in South Africa
3. Water security can actually be improved at a rate the prevents the emerging issues
## Model Evaluation

### Key Project Steps

#### Direction 1

1. Determine how people in South Africa tend to migrate from areas of low water security to urban areas of high water security
2. Demonstrate then how those urban grows become less secure
3. Demonstrate how improving water quality in the developing areas/slums we can reduce migration towards existing urban infrastructure and foster settlement growth
##### Questions
- Why is morphogenetic modelling needed here? Is this more appropriate to model through queueing theory/game theory?
	- We could show the expected distribution of the population and who is most likely to suffer?
- Do the SA government already know where the most important places are to tackle water insecurity?
	- Do they know the impact on larger urban areas if they don't address this?

- #### Direction 2

1. Model how the growth of major waterway networks seems to guide urban expansion in order to inform the development of future waterways towards poorer communities
