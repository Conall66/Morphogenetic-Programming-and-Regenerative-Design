## Cellular Automata
[[Cellular Automata]]
### How it Works?

- Transition matrix determined by a function of neighbouring states, distance from key infrastructure (i.e. city epicentre) etc. - transition matrix can be derived from existing data for most simple model (look at probabilities cells transformed given neighbouring cells)
- Lends itself to Moore neighbourhoods given structure of cells in HSLD
### Additional Approaches

- Markov informed model takes pre-existing states
- Reinforcement learning punishes/updates transformation rules
- Integration of ABM (velocities and repulsive/attractive forces)
- Fuzziness accounts for cell uncertainty
