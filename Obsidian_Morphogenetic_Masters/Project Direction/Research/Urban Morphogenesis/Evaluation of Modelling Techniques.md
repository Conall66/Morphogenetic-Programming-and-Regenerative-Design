### Features
- Short term accuracy: how accurate is each model following one time step
- Long term accuracy: how accurate is the model as we project further into the future (100,000 steps)
- Computational expense: how computationally expensive does the model get as more data points are added?
- Flexibility/versatility: how well can the model anticipate seemingly random changes in the behaviour?
