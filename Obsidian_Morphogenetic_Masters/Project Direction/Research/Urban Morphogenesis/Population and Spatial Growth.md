A number of location theories also seek to explain the spatial and statistical relationships
between population distribution and the major factors that influence location choice and
economic activities. Population geography is the study of changing population distribution,
growth, composition, and migration and seeks to theoretically explain population patterns
caused by spatial patterns and processes (Li, 2010). Based on these theories, regional
16 economics try to explain the associated relationships between land use patterns and
population change, while central place theories place population in a hierarchy of urban places
where the movement of population, businesses, and goods are determined by the associated
costs and city sizes. Similarly, spatial diffusion theories argue that population growth tends to
spread outwards from a city centre to surrounding area, implying that population growth is
spatially auto-correlated (Chi & Marcouiller, 2011).
