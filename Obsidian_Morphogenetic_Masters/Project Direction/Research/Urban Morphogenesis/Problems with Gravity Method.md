In a critical assessment of the IIASA method, Jones (2014) highlights five characteristics that
negatively affect the accuracy of its spatial population distribution outcomes, namely: (1) the
distance decay function limits the range of spatial development patterns that are possible, and
sprawling patterns are most widely observed; (2) the model is vulnerable to border effects,
specifically along coastlines; (3) The model creates unrealistic spatial patterns between urban
and rural boundaries caused by the urban/rural classification distinction, affecting the overall
pattern of projected urbanisation; (4) population loss is incorrectly allocated (and models often
encounter challenges when data sets include negative or zero values) and (5) without the
incorporation of ancillary data, population can be allocated to areas unsuitable for human
development
