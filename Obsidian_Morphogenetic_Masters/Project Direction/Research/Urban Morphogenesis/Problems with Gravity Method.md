In a critical assessment of the IIASA method, Jones (2014) highlights five characteristics that
negatively affect the accuracy of its spatial population distribution outcomes, namely: 
1. The distance decay function limits the range of spatial development patterns that are possible, and sprawling patterns are most widely observed
2. The model is vulnerable to **border effects**, specifically along coastlines; 
3. The model creates unrealistic spatial patterns between urban and rural boundaries caused by the urban/rural classification distinction, affecting the overall pattern of projected urbanisation
4. Population loss is incorrectly allocated (and models often encounter challenges when data sets include negative or zero values) and 
5. Without the incorporation of ancillary data, population can be allocated to areas unsuitable for human development

As a way to mitigate many of its spatial limitations, Jones and Oâ€™Neill (2013) modified the
IIASA method by introducing parameters into their model that account for varying socio-
economic assumptions, using historical data to reflect past spatial development trends and adding an exclusion mask to prevent population allocation in areas unsuitable for human
development.
