## Summary
Methodology for designing an urban 'utopia' that adapts to rising population demands, mapping optimised growth patterns for cities that consider:

- Energy consumption
- Travel distance
- Distribution of green spaces
- Distribution of major infrastructure/facilities
- Air quality
- ... and more

## Problem Areas

- Availability of spatiotemporal data
- Scale and resolution - different settlements of different sizes will have drastically different growth mechanisms

## Potential Direction

- Design morphogenetic models for a number of seemingly disconnected settlement types and employ a second stage of machine learning model to interpret emerging patterns about the influence of environmental factors

## Software

- [SPARTACUS-Surface](https://github.com/ecmwf/spartacus-surface/blob/master/README.md) Canopy radiation open source software - describes buildings' 3D structures statistically (based on land coverage for example)
