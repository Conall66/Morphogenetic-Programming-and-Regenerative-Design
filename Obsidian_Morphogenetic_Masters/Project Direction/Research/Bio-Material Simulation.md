## Problem Definition
[[Bio-materials]] pose an interesting possibility in replacing conventional building materials through green alternatives. The random nature of plant growths in bio-materials might create uncertainties around strength properties, and so it is important to develop uncertainty sets for ensuring a certain degree of reliability.
## Key Assumptions

- [x] One of the major obstacles to widespread adoption of bio-materials is the unreliability in properties 
- [x] Existing models for this information are under-developed
- [x] Bio-materials offer significant benefits over conventional building materials (i.e. concrete)
- [x] Living bio-materials offer unique benefits over dried bio-materials

## Competitive Landscape
Many companies seem to be using bio-materials to develop insulation etc. - nothing for construction purposes

- [Biomason](https://biomason.com/) - calcium carbonate cement (no live modelling software)
- [[Functional Structural Plant Modelling (FSPM) models]] are often used to estimate crop yields rather than biomaterial
