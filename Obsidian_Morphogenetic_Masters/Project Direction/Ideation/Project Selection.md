## Idea 1: Morphogenetic Urban Growth
Using morphogenetic programming to model urban growth patterns, using smart cities analytics, environmental factors and taking social constraints to predict further growth or suggest appropriate improvements
### Why is it Important?
[[A new type of cities for liveable futures]] - The overall growth of the worldâ€™s population could add another **2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa**. Urban environments within these regions will expand to accommodate for rising populations and this presents an opportunity for smart cities.
### Mapping Current Expansion or Informing Future Expansion?


## Idea 2: Smart Building Envelopes
Predicting the growth of engineered living building envelopes and assessing their impact in a number of different situations

## Idea 3: Living Biomaterials Structural Quality
Models for ensuring quality in structural biomaterials (FSPMs with mathematical uncertainty sets)

## Idea 4: Biophilic Design and BIM
Promoting biophilic design with BIM plugin
