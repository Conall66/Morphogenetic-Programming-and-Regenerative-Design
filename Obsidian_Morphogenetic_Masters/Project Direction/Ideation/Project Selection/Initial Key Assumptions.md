- Regenerative architecture can have a significant positive impact on either climate change and sequestration or structural strength, with regard to the effort of integration and implementation over the long term
- Architects are facing problems regarding the implementation of regenerative design and would welcome innovation in the space
- There is space for this project to advance the implementation of regenerative design in different landscapes
- Urban environments are in greater need of ecological intervention and regeneration
- There is room to pivot in this project, with a number of different project directions well suited to a design engineer
