## Stage 1: Data Synthesis

- Convert GIS data for road networks and existing waterways data into combined EPANET file to describe the existing water distribution network
- Cross-reference this with the existing population data and data on access to sanitised water
- Use the Shannon entropy model to assess the interconnectivity of the road network as an indicator of it's reliability (resilience to failure) - highlight key communities that exist (**Outline exactly how the Shannon Entropy Model works**)

## Stage 2: Population Modelling

- Use
