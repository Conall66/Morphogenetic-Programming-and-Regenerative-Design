Is it better to model how existing settlements are expanding into one another (a closer consideration for expected reality) or to model optimised designs and in which scenarios/what are the implications?
## Morphogenetic Cities Expansion

### Advantages
### Where?
**In which areas does it make the most sense to model current expansion patterns?**
- Areas where the dataset is widely accessible
- Areas where nobody has previously modelled, or the results were flawed (could deliberately pick somewhere with low resolution findings to demonstrate the application of different models)
- Areas where urban expansion is occurring at the greatest rate
- Areas that are most heavily under-investigated
- The UK, where we understand regulation and have access to a greater variety in stakeholders

## Optimised Smart Cities Design

### Advantages (15 minute cities)

1. Alleviates traffic congestion
2. Lower carbon footprint (reduced need for cars)
3. Improves health and wellbeing by facilitating walking
4. Accessibility to green spaces
5. Strengthens local economies
6. Reduces strain on local infrastructure (utilities, public transport)
