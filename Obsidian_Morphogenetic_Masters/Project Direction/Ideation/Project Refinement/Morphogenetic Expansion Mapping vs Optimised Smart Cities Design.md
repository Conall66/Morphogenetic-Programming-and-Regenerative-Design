Is it better to model how existing settlements are expanding into one another (a closer consideration for expected reality) or to model optimised designs and in which scenarios/what are the implications?
## Morphogenetic Cities Expansion
### Where?
**In which areas does it make the most sense to model current expansion patterns?**
- Areas where the dataset is widely accessibile
- Areas where nobody has previously modelled, or the results were flawed (could deliberately pick somewhere with low resolution findings to demonstrate the application of different models)
- Areas where urban expansion is occurring at the greatest rate
- Areas that are most heavily under-investigated
