## Problem Contextualisation

1. What is happening worldwide with urbanisation
2. How is it changing, and where is it changing most rapidly
3. What does this mean for major infrastructure, resource strain etc.
4. Choose one particular country (South Africa) as a case study
5. Discuss the problem of urbanisation in South Africa
6. Discuss how fringe settlements expand
7. What does this mean for fresh water supplies?
8. City planners are not working in conjunction with water infrastructure planners
9. Aim to inform policy changes (give example of where these models have previously influenced growth mechanisms)
10. Outline project proposal - building morphogenetic growth patterns of built environment

## Methodology
[[Methodology Summary]]

1. Derive relationship between water scarcity and urban morphology
## Datasets

- Google Earth - can extract information from timeline, quality of information worsens as you go back in time, extracting urban morphological information will be difficult
- World Human Settlement Database - 

## Research

- Water consumption patterns by morphological environment and urban density
