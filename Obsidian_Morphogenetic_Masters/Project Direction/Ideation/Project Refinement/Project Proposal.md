Sub-Sharan Africa is set to account for 50% of urban growth by 2050 with the rapid population increase. Accessibility to sanitised water will continue to drop as climate change worsens, and the water industry must adapt accordingly.

## Datasets

- Google Earth - can extract information from timeline, quality of information worsens as you go back in time, extracting urban morphological information will be difficult
