## Problem Contextualisation

1. What is happening worldwide with urbanisation
2. How is it changing, and where is it changing most rapidly
3. What does this mean for major infrastructure, resource strain etc.
4. Choose one particular country (South Africa) as a case study
5. Discuss the problem of urbanisation in South Africa
6. Discuss how fringe settlements expand
7. What does this mean for fresh water supplies?
8. City planners are not working in conjunction with water infrastructure planners
9. Aim to inform policy changes (give example of where these models have previously influenced growth mechanisms)
10. Outline project proposal - building morphogenetic growth patterns of built environment

## Methodology
[[Methodology Summary]]

1. Derive relationship between water scarcity and urban morphology
	1. Morphology will be categorised into undeveloped land, residential land and built urban land, with information on the population density
	2. Water scarcity will be a binary input

		1. Determine relationship between morphology, population density and water scarcity
## Datasets
[[Datasets]]
### Spatiotemporal Data
- **[Global Human Settlement Layer Databases on Built Environments](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/datasets.php)**- Spatiotemporal data for the entire world on:
	- Distribution of built-up non-residential buildings
	- Distribution of building heights
	- Delineated [[Morphological Settlement Zone]] (with information on the inner classification of the morphology and function of built environment)
	- [Slum Dwellers International Data Portal](https://sdinet.org/explore-our-data/country/?country=south-africa) - database has fragmented information on prioritised development needs, water availability and most common diseases by slums across South Africa and other developing countries
- 

### Population Density


### Water Scarcity


## Research

- Water consumption patterns by morphological environment and urban density
