## Modelling the impact of social/crowd dynamics in Iso-beneficial Urban Expansion

What are the leading factors in how people operate within city environments? Demographics (age, race, gender etc.), accessibility to major utilities, distance from major roads/connection routes, gentrification, heritage (distance to family members), 

### Necessary Steps

1. Develop a working understanding of the leading social factors in population distribution across settlements
2. Understand how likely people are to move once situated and how that affects allocation of spaces/ major utilities etc.
3. Possibly model how demographics are shifting within settlements and build some kind of predictive model for future distribution (existing) to compare with
4. Build cellular automata model and compare with agent based, lattice free model and machine learning analysis of existing settlements (check to see if these models are open sourced)

| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Less need for accessibility to data                           | May be dependent on existing ML models            |
| Interesting social psychology and crowd dynamics applications | Less likely to focus on geographical constraints  |
| Focus on a selected region for fixed boundary conditions      | Less representative of real life without GIS data |
| Potential to compare multiple approaches                      |                                                   |

## Optimised Settlement Expansion

Build models of under-developed settlements expanding into one another, and how that open up new connectivity options. Isolate key nodes in the system and implement Markov chains to predict major infrastructure points.
