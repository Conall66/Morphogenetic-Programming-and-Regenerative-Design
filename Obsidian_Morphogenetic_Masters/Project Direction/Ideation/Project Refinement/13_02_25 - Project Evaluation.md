## Projects

1. Plot waterways expansion for Cape Town and highlight critical nodes. Determine how investment in repairs/new infrastructure might make the city more resilient (minimise the presence of communities)
2. Stochastic modelling for urban sprawl using cellular automata and Markov chains
3. City growth optimisation balancing multiple SDGs
4. Open sourced CA-Markov chains modelling for improved analysis going forward

## Questions

### Project 1

- Do I need to know what cities will look like first?
- Can I get road networks dataset?
- Does road networks data resemble wat
