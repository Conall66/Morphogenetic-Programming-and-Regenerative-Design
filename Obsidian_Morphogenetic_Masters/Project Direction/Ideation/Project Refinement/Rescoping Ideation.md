1. Use gravity based downscaling approach to determine the governing factors behind different types of growth in South Africa (i.e. population, potential earnings in informal settlements, urban centres etc.)
	1. Specifically predict urban sprawl for informal settlements
2. More interactive platform for monitoring city growth, assessing the prevalence of informal settlements, road and water infrastructure etc.
3. Assess the value of large scale water infrastructure investments vs gravity based alternatives from quality of life PoV - identifying where to optimally situate these

## What we Know

- Urban populations are set to drastically spike between now and 2050 in sub-Saharan Africa
- This will result in rapid city growth, whether that occurs through densification or urban sprawl
- Likely, this rapid population growth will 

### What to Aim For

- Multiple studies showing continual growth for a particular case study, following the SSP outcomes
-
