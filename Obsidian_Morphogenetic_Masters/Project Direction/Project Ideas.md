## Project Directions

- Identify scenarios in which biological design in architectural or civil spheres are most impactful
- Establish mechanisms for ensuring desirable qualities within biomaterials (i.e. mycelium stone)
- Modelling morphogenetic growth in 3 dimensions, investigating the accuracy of dynamic point cloud generation, reinforcement learning and mathematical/rule driven/L-function approaches
- Converting volumetric generated structures into STL/STEP files for testing strength properties for modelling reinforcement (FEA)
- Model carbon absorption, damaged incurred to bonded structure over time etc.
- Inform the design of new structures aimed at working with regenerative plant growth
- Establish the relative ‘randomness’ to build uncertainty values and enforce homogeneous design properties
- Morphogenetic approach to smart cities layout (track how biological pathways form in order to minimise distance travelled between functional nodes)
- Morphogenetic building envelope identification AI
- Bacterial regenerative concrete modelling (AI/Optimisation model for automating bacterial selection and concentration based on temperature, soil pH, competition etc.)
- [[4D printed bio-structures]] for typical grey-infrastructure projects
- Data product collating information on green infrastructure worldwide
- Design morphogenetic models for a number of seemingly disconnected settlement types and employ a second stage of machine learning model to interpret emerging patterns about the influence of environmental factors
	- Employ agent based models rather than latticed grid layout for accuracy [[Agent based modelling (ABM) of morphogenetic systems]]
	- Potential game theory modelling applications in land allocation - account for more realistic interplay dynamics
	- Morphogenetic expansion and climate prediction/mitigation models - specifically designing cities to minimise carbon output
### Non Architectural

- Morphogenetic tissue growth modelling
- Morphogenetic/cellular automata founded hash functions for distributed ledgers technologies (i.e. blockchain)
## Project Outcomes

- BIM modelling software to aid architects in the design of regenerative infrastructure
- Modelling package that assesses the regenerative nature of a project
- Software plugin that models biological growths over time when left unattended
- Mathematical models for assessing the strength properties of biomaterials through morphogenetic programming

## Initial Visions

- Motorways, car parks, billboards, sea walls, bridges - there are a number of concrete structures that don't require complex thermal regulation or air quality control for example that are perfect for fostering natural growths and biodiversity in urban environments, so why don't we incorporate bio materials and biophilic design in these contexts?
