## Morphology
- **[Global Human Settlement Layer Databases on Built Environments](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/datasets.php)**- Spatiotemporal data for the entire world on:
	- Distribution of built-up non-residential buildings
	- Distribution of building heights
	- Delineated [[Morphological Settlement Zone]] (with information on the inner classification of the morphology and function of built environment)
	- [Slum Dwellers International Data Portal](https://sdinet.org/explore-our-data/country/?country=south-africa) - database has fragmented information on prioritised development needs, water availability and most common diseases by slums across South Africa and other developing countries
- [Major Infrastructure SA Time Series](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/world-bank-infrastructure-indicators-for-south-africa) - shows for the whole of SA how much investment into different types of infrastructure (telecommunications, transport, freshwater resources)
- [Open Source SA Toolkit](https://opendataza.gitbook.io/toolkit/open-data-resources/water-and-climate-data-resources) - seems to be open data sets on spatial land and infrastructure use as well as water and climate information
- [Access to Water by Municipalities Time Series](https://www.dws.gov.za/niwis2/Sanitation/AccessToServices) - Information on access to sanitised water backlog on population by municipality over time (can use population information to show rate of migration towards urban environments)
- [Urbanisation Over Time SA - Office for National Statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226106/urbanization-rate-in-africa/) - for the whole of SA rather than by region
