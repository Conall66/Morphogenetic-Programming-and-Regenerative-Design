## Morphology

- **[Global Human Settlement Layer Databases on Built Environments](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/datasets.php)**- Spatiotemporal data for the entire world on:
	- Distribution of built-up non-residential buildings
	- Distribution of building heights
	- Delineated [[Morphological Settlement Zone]] (with information on the inner classification of the morphology and function of built environment)
	- [Slum Dwellers International Data Portal](https://sdinet.org/explore-our-data/country/?country=south-africa) - database has fragmented information on prioritised development needs, water availability and most common diseases by slums across South Africa and other developing countries

- [Major Infrastructure SA Time Series](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/world-bank-infrastructure-indicators-for-south-africa) - shows for the whole of SA how much investment into different types of infrastructure (telecommunications, transport, freshwater resources)
- [Open Source SA Toolkit](https://opendataza.gitbook.io/toolkit/open-data-resources/water-and-climate-data-resources) - seems to be open data sets on spatial land and infrastructure use as well as water and climate information
- [Access to Water by Municipalities Time Series](https://www.dws.gov.za/niwis2/Sanitation/AccessToServices) - Information on access to sanitised water backlog on population by municipality over time (can use population information to show rate of migration towards urban environments)
- [Urbanisation Over Time SA - Office for National Statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1226106/urbanization-rate-in-africa/) - for the whole of SA rather than by region
- [Settlement Data WorldPop](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=17253) - available in 1 year increments from 2001 - 2020 but only has binary value (0-1)

## Population Density

- [Department of Statistics SA](https://www.statssa.gov.za/) -population by municipality
- [Worldpop](https://www.worldpop.org/) - use a bottom up dataset: Here, sample data from as many trustworthy and recent survey datasets as possible are used with detailed geospatial datasets to build a statistical model to estimate population numbers and age/sex breakdowns in unsampled locations, together with measurements of uncertainty. This approach can also be used to fill gaps in a census where full enumeration is not possible due to conflict, poor access or financial limitations

## Water Sanitation

[DWS Population with Reliable Water](https://www.dws.gov.za/niwis2/WaterSupplyReliability?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1) - The data is extracted via Macro Planning processes and procedures directly from the Water Services Knowledge System database
	Based off information [Department of Statistics SA](https://ws.dws.gov.za/wsks/spatial_OnTrack_leaf.aspx?SubjectAreaID=2&DataTopicDetailID=77&DisplayTypeId=7&PerspectiveID=0&LvlID=10&DataTopicID=35) - access to sanitised water by municipality, year dating to 1994
