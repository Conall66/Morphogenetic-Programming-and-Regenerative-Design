[[Crowd Modelling and Simulation Tech]]

### Crowd Modelling
- ~~MASSIVE~~ - not much information on technical details of model, mainly for animation, difficult to adapt
- ~~A.I.IMPLANT~~ - not much information on technical details of model, mainly for animation, difficult to adapt
- Crowd Dynamics (& Legion) - psychological and social factors are hardly considered, but path-of-least-resistance calculations integrated, mainly used for operational analysis
- VRLAB@EPFL - great with many 3D models, uses lattice free model
- Media Research Lab@NYU - complex models of urban environments (namely Pennsylvania city, New York City etc.), supports A* algorithm, agents have 'line of sight' for decision making which is even over-ridden by large groups to simulate the attention failures of the individual, implemented on DI robot (Boston Dynamics)
- VMASC - used for military purposes, focussed at group and crowd level not considering individual cognition
- Centre for Human Modelling @ Pennsylvania
