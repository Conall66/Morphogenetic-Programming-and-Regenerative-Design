## Project Directions

- Identify scenarios in which biological design in architectural or civil spheres are most impactful
- Establish mechanisms for ensuring desirable qualities within biomaterials (i.e. mycelium stone)
- Modelling morphogenetic growth in 3 dimensions, investigating the accuracy of dynamic point cloud generation, reinforcement learning and mathematical/rule driven/L-function approaches
- Converting volumetric generated structures into STL/STEP files for testing strength properties for modelling reinforcement (FEA)
- Model carbon absorption, damaged incurred to bonded structure over time etc.
- Inform the design of new structures aimed at working with regenerative plant growth
- Establish the relative ‘randomness’ to build uncertainty values and enforce homogeneous design properties
- Morphogenetic approach to smart cities layout (track how biological pathways form in order to minimise distance travelled between functional nodes)
- Morphogenetic building envelope identification AI

### Non Architectural

- Morphogenetic tissue growth modelling
- Morphogenetic/cellular automata founded hash functions for distributed ledgers technologies (i.e. blockchain)

## Project Outcomes

- BIM modelling software to aid architects in the design of regenerative infrastructure
- Modelling package that assesses the regenerative nature of a project
- Software plugin that models biological growths over time when left unattended
- Mathematical models for assessing the strength properties of biomaterials through morphogenetic programming
