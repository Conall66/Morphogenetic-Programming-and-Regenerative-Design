## Problem Definition
[[Bio-materials]] pose an interesting possibility in replacing conventional building materials through green alternatives. The random nature of plant growths in bio-materials might create uncertainties around strength properties, and so it is important to develop uncertainty sets for ensuring a certain degree of reliability.
## Key Assumptions

- One of the major obstacles to widespread adoption of bio-materials is the unreliability in properties
- Existing models for this information are under-developed
- Bio-materials offer significant benefits over conventional building materials (i.e. concrete)
- Living bio-materials offer unique benefits over dried bio-materials
