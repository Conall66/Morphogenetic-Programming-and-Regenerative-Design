[Morphogenesis of Isobenefit urbanism: Isobenefit-cities simulator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711023001048)
## Summary

- **Context**: Cities evolve their size, shape and function by following internal and external forces such as demography, work places, real estate markets, societal needs-choice, regional-national-international networks, history, politics, technology, preferences, planning, spontaneous emergence, geography, climate, orography and randomness.
- **Urban Morphogenesis**: Methodology for designing an urban 'utopia' that adapts to rising population demands

Principles of iso-beneficial cellular automata:
1. Each citizen within 1-2km of (a) a centrality (b) a green area
2. Buildings are close to one another and interconnected
3. Green areas are connected by at least 1sq.km

**Direct Benefits**
- Minimise travel distances
- Better fairer distribution of facilities
- Scalability
- Better land management/space usage

**Indirect Benefits**
- Reduction of heat island effects
- Reduction in flooding for over cementification
- Minimised congestion
- Dispersed pollutions
- Healthier environments
