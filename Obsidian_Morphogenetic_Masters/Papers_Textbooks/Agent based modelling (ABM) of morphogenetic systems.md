## Summary

![[2 Approaches to Morphogenetic Programming.jpg | 400]]

- Agent based modelling creates the possibility for integrating Turing's RD diffusion model and Wolpert's PI model for a more accurate representation of morphogenetic growth patterns
- Complex organomorphic models can't be developed using PDEs (computational complexity)
- ABMs are particularly adept at capturing spatial information and are not confined to the custom grid layout other mathematical models would adopt

## Next Steps

- No formal mathematical model for PI modelling has been developed
- Investigate the possibility for different cell structure shapes in more accurate ABM/CPM models
- Machine learning informed rule driven ABM
