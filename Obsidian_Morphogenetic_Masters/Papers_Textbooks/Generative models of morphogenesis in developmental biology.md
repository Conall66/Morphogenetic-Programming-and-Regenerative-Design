[Generative models of morphogenesis in developmental biology 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952123000290)

## Key Findings

- Morphogenetic programming important in understanding disease migration, wound healing and developmental biology
- Morphogenesis must consider both chemical and physical cues
- The complex dynamic between the cell, its environment, and its internal [cytoskeleton](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cytoskeleton "Learn more about cytoskeleton from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") results in three broad classes of migratory modes: _amoeboid, epithelial, and mesenchymal
- Using RMS velocity information on individual cells within a system we can estimate the probability of glass transition phase
