## Key Findings

- pH and temperature can have a significant impact on bacterial concrete regenerative properties
- Bacterial cell concentration affects concrete's hardened properties
- Successful application in tunnels, water channels, retaining wall panels, and highways
- Studies have found that the mechanical of concrete can be increased at cell concentrations of 105 to 108Â cells/ml
