## Key Findings

- pH and temperature can have a significant impact on bacterial concrete regenerative properties
- Bacterial cell concentration affects concrete's hardened properties
- Successful application in tunnels, water channels, retaining wall panels, and highways
- Studies have found that the mechanical strength of concrete can be increased at cell concentrations of 10^5 to 10^8Â cells/ml
- Normal concrete is subject to issues around thermal cracking corrosion cracking, premature drying and other conditions
- Every year, a considerable global budget is set aside for the restoration of current concrete structures
- In some construction projects, 20% of the repair deteriorates within duration of 5 years, and 55% deteriorates within 10 years
- Concrete waste constitutes 59% of global waste with 40% ending up in landfill
- Of autogenous and autonomous healing approaches, bacterial shows the most promising results
- Different bacteria show different strength properties at the same density

### Encapsulation Method

- In order to protect bacteria in the production of bacterial cement (from the mixing process, pH of the concrete, hydration of cement etc.), they are encapsulated inside a non-reactive material [Effectiveness of Encapsulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221478532035656X) 
## Future Studies Recommendations

- Exploring spray method to protect bacteria from the harsh environment of concrete, enabling the use of a wider range of bacterial species and enhancing the self-healings effectiveness
