## What is Morphogenetic Programming?
Inspired by the processes of biological growths (morphogenesis), morphogenetic programming is an approach towards computationally simulating biological structures and patterns in order to inform architectural and engineering developments. Biological growth patterns present a number of evolutionary advantages in and around strength properties, ventilation, water cycle management, material reduction and biodiversity.

- Structures can adapt to changing environments
- Reinforcement potential/load distribution
- Energy utilisation
## Where is it Useful?

- Construction and architecture [[Regenerative Design Intro]]
- [[Functional Structural Plant Modelling (FSPM) models]] for determining/predicting crop yields
- Urban planning [[Smart Cities and Regenerative Design]]
- Furniture
## Approaches

- [[Differential Growth]]
- [[L Systems and Recursion]]
- [[Flocking and Swarming]]
## Examples

## Competitive Landscape

- [Morphogenetic Generative Design](https://www.3ds.com/insights/corporate-reports/generative-design-inspired-living-world) - Catia have developed a morphogenetic generative design structure, but is very reductive/simplistic in mechanistic approach
