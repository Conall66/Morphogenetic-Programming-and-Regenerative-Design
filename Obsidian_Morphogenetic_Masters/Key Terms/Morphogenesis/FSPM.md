Functional-structural plant modelling (FSPM) refers to a paradigm for the description of a plant by creating a (usually object-oriented) computer model of its structure and selected physiological and physical processes, at different hierarchical levels: organ, plant individual, canopy (a stand of plants), and in which the processes are modulated by the local environment. Structure comprises the explicit topology (connection between organs) and geometry (orientation, inclination, and shape) of the organs and the plant. At the individual level, this is also referred to as plant architecture [FSPM Definition](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-9863-7_1479)
