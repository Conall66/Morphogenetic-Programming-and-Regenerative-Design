- Identify scenarios in which biological design in architectural or civil spheres are most impactful
- Establish mechanisms for ensuring desirable qualities within biomaterials (i.e. mycelium stone)
- Modelling morphogenetic growth in 3 dimensions, investigating the accuracy of dynamic point cloud generation, reinforcement learning and mathematical/rule driven/L-function approaches
- Coverting volumetric generated structures into STL/STEP files for testing strength properties for modelling reinforcement (FEA)
- Model carbon absorption, damaged incurred to bonded structure over time etc.
- Inform the design of new structures aimed at working with regenerative plant growth
- Establish the relative ‘randomness’ to build uncertainty values and enforce homogeneous design properties
