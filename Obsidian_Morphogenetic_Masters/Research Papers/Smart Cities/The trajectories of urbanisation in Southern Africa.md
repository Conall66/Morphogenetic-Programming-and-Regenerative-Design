[The trajectories of urbanisation in Southern Africa: A comparative analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197397523000073)
## Summary

This paper assesses the trajectory of urbanisation in Southern Africa over the last 40 years. This is one of the fastest urbanising regions of the world. It analyses four themes: citiesâ€™ growth rates, size distribution, built-up areas and urban density. In SA, there has been a gradual decline in urban growth rate. Growth is unevenly distributed across the size spectrum, with the largest cities growing much faster than smaller cities. In addition, the highest urban densities are in the poorest countries, suggesting that density takes the form of overcrowded informal settlements rather than liveable and productive places
