## Summary
This study explores how [[Transformative adaptation (TA)]], which addresses the root causes of climate risk, can be operationalized in southern African cities using criteria like inclusivity, challenging power asymmetries, flexibility, and systems thinking. Through five water-related projects in Durban and Harare, the research highlights the need for equitable participation and acknowledges the challenges of achieving TA in complex contexts, proposing a pragmatic, learning-oriented approach to gradually scale up transformative efforts.

The paper assesses different measures takes to improve water quality in Harare and Durban, 2 South African cities, evaluating them on criteria related to transformative adaptation (see criteria below).
## Key Points

- In SA, the population is rapidly growing in towns and cities driving urban expansion
- "**Population growth has outstripped job creation**, infrastructure expansion, property development, and public service provision, resulting in severe lack of public services, gainful employment, affordable housing and secure land tenure for many residents. These hardships create **high vulnerability to climate hazards** (e.g. heavy rainfall, intense heat, prolonged drought), and consequent impacts, e.g. flooded homes, the spread of diseases, food and water scarcity"
- **Climatic hazards are expected to intensify** across much of the southern African region in the coming decades {...} that disproportionately affect the poorer communities
- **"There are intensifying calls to transform cities in ways that foster social and spatial inclusion, equitable economic opportunities, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience"**
- "Many studies point to the need to transform governance and decision making to manage complex issues such as climate risk"
- "There is a strong need for more empirical testing, application, operationalization and evaluation of [[Transformative adaptation (TA)]]"
- "Climate risks manifest across numerous sectors, but **water-related risks are recognised as being particularly acute in the southern African context**"
### Important Criteria in Transformative Adaptation

- Fundamental changes in though processes behind implementation
- Inclusivity
- Challenge 'power' asymmetries 
- Demonstrability - must be possible to implement 
- Flexibility
### Climate Related Water Risks

- Degraded wetlands
- Poverty
- Flood protection
- Degraded riverine
- Poor waste management
## Limitations

## Musings

- Develop a model that shows how population density around key waterways will change in future as scarcity increases
	- Need to form governing rules (i.e. punishment for distance from key waterways, access to major city infrastructure etc.) - work with Anna to determine these
	- Show how SA infrastructure will continue evolving if no intervention is imposed, and how development could be optimised or new waterways could be installed to combat the most susceptible areas
- City expansion guided by criteria for transformative adaptation
