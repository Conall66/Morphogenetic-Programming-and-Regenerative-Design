## Summary
This study explores how [[Transformative adaptation (TA)]], which addresses the root causes of climate risk, can be operationalized in southern African cities using criteria like inclusivity, challenging power asymmetries, flexibility, and systems thinking. Through five water-related projects in Durban and Harare, the research highlights the need for equitable participation and acknowledges the challenges of achieving TA in complex contexts, proposing a pragmatic, learning-oriented approach to gradually scale up transformative efforts.

The paper assesses different measures takes to improve water quality in Harare and Durban, 2 South African cities, evaluating them on criteria related to transformative adaptation (see criteria below).
## Key Points

- In SA, the population is rapidly growing in towns and cities driving urban expansion
- "**Population growth has outstripped job creation**, infrastructure expansion, property development, and public service provision, resulting in severe lack of public services, gainful employment, affordable housing and secure land tenure for many residents. These hardships create **high vulnerability to climate hazards** (e.g. heavy rainfall, intense heat, prolonged drought), and consequent impacts, e.g. flooded homes, the spread of diseases, food and water scarcity"
- **Climatic hazards are expected to intensify** across much of the southern African region in the coming decades {...} that disproportionately affect the poorer communities
- **"There are intensifying calls to transform cities in ways that foster social and spatial inclusion, equitable economic opportunities, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience"**
- "Many studies point to the need to transform governance and decision making to manage complex issues such as climate risk"
- "There is a strong need for more empirical testing, application, operationalization and evaluation of [[Transformative adaptation (TA)]]"
- "Climate risks manifest across numerous sectors, but **water-related risks are recognised as being particularly acute in the southern African context**"

![[Interdependent TA.jpg]]

- "TA might best be attempted as a process of **gradual** re-imagining and restructuring of incremental adaptation efforts, which are sequenced and expanded, in scale and ambition, towards TA. The question then becomes **how approaches characterised by ‘quick, small wins’ can transition into larger, more complex approaches that are associated with large-scale, fundamental change**"
- There exists a silo mentality, where individual institutions act in their own interest rather than the interest of the collective
- Important to tie sustainability measures into 'job creation' and other more tangible benefits for the community
- "Realising the interplay between demonstrability and holistic, complex systems thinking seems **particularly important in the context of resource-constrained southern African cities**, where decision-makers and implementers are under much pressure from day-to-day public service delivery issues"
- "Modular designs would need to ensure that there is potential for the project to change over time, and the resources and mechanisms (including participatory monitoring and evaluation) to support such emergence"
### Important Criteria in Transformative Adaptation

- Fundamental changes in though processes behind implementation
- Inclusivity
- Challenge 'power' asymmetries 
- Demonstrability - must be possible to implement 
- Flexibility
### Climate Related Water Risks

- Degraded wetlands
- Poverty
- Flood protection
- Degraded riverine
- Poor waste management
### Case Studies

- The Sihlanzimvelo Stream Cleaning Programme: Removing alien invasive plants and solid waste from Sihlanzimvelo Stream
- Harare Wetlands Advocacy Project: Improve citizen awareness of wetlands protection, influencing the adoption of environmental impact assessments
- Palmiet Catchment Rehabilitation Project: Conservation, rehabilitation & restoration of natural systems within the Palmiet Catchment to improve resilience of communities living nearby
- Aller River Pilot Project: Restore health of rivers in Durban (i.e. clearing invasive species)
- Wize Wayz Water Case: 
## Limitations

- The paper only explores 2 case studies that are, in themselves, quite different. Different communities are likely to adopt different attitudes
- These 2 cities are quite large - does not explore smaller settlement expansion

## Musings

- Develop a model that shows how population density around key waterways will change in future as scarcity increases
	- Need to form governing rules (i.e. punishment for distance from key waterways, access to major city infrastructure etc.) - work with Anna to determine these
	- Show how SA infrastructure will continue evolving if no intervention is imposed, and how development could be optimised or new waterways could be installed to combat the most susceptible areas
- City expansion guided by criteria for transformative adaptation in South African cities - model to create a stable system [[Water Availability and South African Morphogenetic Growth]]
	- Can I model 'trust' as a key criteria for agents?
	- Can I model how settlements expand into one another, and how water scarcity changes as a result?
	- Can I use Shapley values to prove that communities can all benefit from collaboration to tackle the 'silo mentality'?
	- Build in a metric for evaluating the success of projects - developments can be retracted if they are not aiding the community
## Questions

- How is climate change going to induce more problems in South African settlements specifically?
	- Can I derive a direct link between climate change and water scarcity that relates to the water infrastructure already existing?
- How useful would it be to model the city development with these TA constraints in place - can I create probabilistically informed suggestions on how to expand the city infrastructure to maximise public trust and climate resilience?
