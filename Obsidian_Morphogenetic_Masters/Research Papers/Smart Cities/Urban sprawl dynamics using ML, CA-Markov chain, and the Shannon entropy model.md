## Summary

The study investigates urban sprawl in Mbombela, South Africa, from 2003 to 2033, using machine learning, CA-Markov models, and Shannon entropy. It highlights significant land use changes: built-up areas and vegetation expanded, while water bodies and open land decreased. Techniques like Landsat imagery, SVM classification, and entropy analysis revealed the spatial-temporal patterns of urban growth. Predictive modelling shows further urban expansion by 2033. The findings emphasize sustainable urban planning to mitigate the environmental impacts of rapid urbanization, supporting policymaker decisions (ChatGPT)
## Key Points

- Used NASA geospatial imaging satellite to categorise morphology (LANDSAT) 
- Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will account for 50% of global population growth by 2050
- Improper urban land use planning has significantly impacted the loss of potentially productive agricultural land
- Machine learning models ([[Clue-S model]]) are more accurate than agent based modelling is a small scale study 
## Limitations

## Datasets
