## Summary

## Key Points

### Modelling Crowd Sizes

The crowd size often determines the types of approaches used to model a crowd. For example, existing work on modeling huge-sized crowd usually treats the crowd as a whole and focuses on the global trend of the crowd, due to the tremendous computational cost involved. For a small to medium-sized crowd, the relative small size of the crowd allows researchers to model the behavior of the individuals
in the crowd. Such individual-based approaches usually build more details into the
crowd model and support investigation of crowd dynamics at individual level
