## Summary

This paper gives an up-to-date account of different crowd modelling software devices and evaluates them against one-another.
## Key Points

### Modelling Crowd Sizes

The crowd size often determines the types of approaches used to model a crowd. For example, existing work on modelling huge-sized crowd usually treats the crowd as a whole and focuses on the global trend of the crowd, due to the tremendous computational cost involved. For a small to medium-sized crowd, the relative small size of the crowd allows researchers to model the behaviour of the individuals in the crowd. Such individual-based approaches usually build more details into the crowd model and support investigation of crowd dynamics at individual level.
#### 3 Criteria

1. Long time frame
2. Short time frame
3. Large crowd sizes
#### Flow Models (Large Crowd Sizes)
See [[Software List]]
#### Agent Based Models
See [[Agents cells and cities]]

The decision rules for an agent are usually based on some local information that are relevant to the agent.
### Social Constraints

The modelling approach may have significant impact on the simulated crowd behaviour and also the runtime performance of the system. Thus it must be carefully chosen by a modeler. The other aspect is the behavioural factors being considered. These factors include tangible factors like physical and physiological characteristics of individuals (e.g., position, speed, etc.), and intangible factors like social factors and psychological factors (e.g., family tie, emotion, etc.).
## Limitations

## Other Musings

- Has anyone explored a clustering approach to large crowd size models?
