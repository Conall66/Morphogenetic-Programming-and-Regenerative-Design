## Summary
This paper identified underlying rules in 3 different approaches to city expansion using AGM cellular automata

## Potential Future Development

- Converting policies into constraints for cellular automata models ("Currently the extent to which CA/CS and agent-based models of urban systems can be fully implemented for policy applications is quite limited")
- "But the biggest problem with all these models is their lack of parsimony. The richness of the data required makes calibration and estimation difficult and predictive accuracy hard to assess in terms of past simulations."
- "To what extent can formal models be built which will provide robust enough forecasts for real policy analysis?"
