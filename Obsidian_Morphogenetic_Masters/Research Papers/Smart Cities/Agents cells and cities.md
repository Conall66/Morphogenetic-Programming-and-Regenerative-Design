## Summary
This paper identified underlying rules in 3 different approaches to city expansion using AGM cellular automata

## Potential Future Development

- Converting policies into constraints for cellular automata models ("Currently the extent to which CA/CS and agent-based models of urban systems can be fully implemented for policy applications is quite limited)
