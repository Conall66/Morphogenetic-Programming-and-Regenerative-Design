[Analysing impacts of urban morphological variables and density on outdoor microclimate for tropical cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132322008769)
## Summary

This paper aims to answer 4 key questions about urban sprawl in Southern Africa:

- What is the growth rate of cities in this region?
- What is the size distribution of cities?
- What is their rate of outward expansion?
- What are the trends in urban density?

## Key Points

- Urban growth occurs much more quickly in larger cities, but the population rise increase much more quickly in smaller informal settlements
- "More contextual and locally responsive policies are vital if the urbanisation process is to be guided and managed sustainably and inclusively"
- Over-simplified models often encourage movement away from expansion in larger settlements based on "sensational claims" to aid political agendas for example
