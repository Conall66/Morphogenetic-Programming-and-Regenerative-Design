## Key Concepts

- **Flourishing**: Going back to Aristotle and beyond, the concept of human flourishing has been at the heart of the most basic of philosophical questions: what does it mean to live well? ‘Eudaimonia’, sometimes translated as ‘happiness’, but best understood as ‘human flourishing’, is the ultimate good that people aim for, both as individuals and as society.

A system is influenced by its environment, defined by its structure and purpose, and expressed through its function. Infrastructure is the interconnected ‘system of systems’ that provides the physical foundation for our society. It does more than just provide water, power or transport services; it helps to make cities liveable, boosts quality of life and supports productivity and prosperity, all in the context of its interface with the natural environment.
