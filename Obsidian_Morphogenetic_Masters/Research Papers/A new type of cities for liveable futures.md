## Summary

## Key Points

- Most planetary problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, ecological degradation, pollution, as well as humans psychological and physical well-being **are linked with degenerative urban design**
- Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations: “the overall growth of the world’s population could add another **2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa**"
- The most likely population growth scenario might be a logistic S-shaped curve in which a global population of 10-11 billion would eventually stabilize in the 22nd century, and probably entirely urban

### Model Construction

![[Model Construction Mathematics.png]]
The city is a matrix (M) of point (k), where $B_i,_k$ is the benefit in $k$ given from point $i$: when $i$ is a neutral point, there will be no benefit; when there is an amenity there will be a benefit; when there is a 'dis-amenity' there will be a negative “benefit”. The overall benefit a point receives from the entire urban points should tend to be “constant” $c$ everywhere for each $k$. Idem the Fuzzy Urban Quality $F$. The value of this “constant” $c$ is above a certain level $c*$

The time $T_d,_k$ one needs to reach the ordinary daily points $d$ from home (work places, recreational and educational places, green areas, shops …) should not be higher than a reasonable time $T*$ which is around 15 minutes walking (namely within around 1 km)

$C$ is an urban centrality and can be a landmark or a collection of local amenities. At least one centrality must be reachable within $T*$

Must be able to reach natural lands $N$ within $T*$
