[Bridging the gap between urban morphology and urban modelling](file:///C:/Users/conal/Downloads/G__UM+14(2)_Viewpoints123-124.pdf)
## Summary

This paper discusses the parallels between urban modelling and morphogenesis, and some of the limitations in existing models. 

## Key Points

- The apparent similarity in the conceptualization of the processes of urban form generation and change shared by urban morphology and urban microsimulation highlights the prospects for an intellectual marriage between the two fields by which both parties can engage in a more direct exchange of ideas and knowledge. This opportunity for interdisciplinary cross-fertilization, however, **remains underexplored**.
- **The highly restrictive assumptions about urban form characteristic of the early examples of urban modelling still remain a key challenge** in contemporary urban microsimulation.
- A basic recognition of the constituent elements of urban form **(land ownership pattern, street networks, and building types)**, critical in the analysis of urban morphology, is all but absent from CA and ABM simulations
- Improving the level of realism in representing urban environments derived from the integration of urban morphological concepts in urban microsimulation can lead not only to an enhanced theoretical and empirical grounding of the models, but to a better comprehension of the model design and outcomes as well
