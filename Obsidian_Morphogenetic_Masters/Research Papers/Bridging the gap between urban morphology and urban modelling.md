[Bridging the gap between urban morphology and urban modelling](file:///C:/Users/conal/Downloads/G__UM+14(2)_Viewpoints123-124.pdf)
## Summary

## Key Points
- The apparent similarity in the conceptualization of the processes of urban form generation and change shared by urban morphology and urban microsimulation highlights the prospects for an intellectual marriage between the two fields by which both parties can engage in a more direct exchange of ideas and knowledge. This opportunity for interdisciplinary cross-fertilization, however, **remains underexplored**.
- The highly restrictive assumptions about urban form characteristic of the early examples of urban modelling still remain a key challenge in contemporary urban microsimulation.
