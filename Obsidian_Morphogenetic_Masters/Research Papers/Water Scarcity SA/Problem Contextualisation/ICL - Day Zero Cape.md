## Summary

## Key Points

- The Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) supplies water from these reservoirs via its distribution networks16 . When water restrictions have not applied, around 70% of the water supplied by WCWSS is allocated to urban and industrial users, with 30% for agricultural use.
- Projects targeting water demand typically yield faster results with low investment cost when compared with increasing water supply
- The South African government has drastically risen tariffs on water consumption since the Day Zero disaster

### Definitions

- **Day Zero:** The estimated day on which reservoir levels supplying Cape Town fall below 13.5% of capacity - early 2018 estimated Cape Town would run out of water
- **Groundwater:**  Water that seeps underground after falling as rain, in between the porous soil, sand and rock, forming bodies of water known as aquifers
- **Indigent Households:** Households consisting of residents lacking the necessities of life, including sufficient water and basic sanitation
