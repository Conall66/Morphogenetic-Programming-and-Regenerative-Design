[Trade-offs between sustainable development goals in systems of cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2226585622000346)
## Summary
The UN SDGs are inherently contradictory/conflicting when observed on a city scale. This paper compares how the relationship between transport emissions is inversely proportional to innovation utility following [[Zipf's Law]]
## Further Developments

- Add further SDG dimensions (i.e. wage inequalities and city size)
- Consider social dynamics and technological innovation
