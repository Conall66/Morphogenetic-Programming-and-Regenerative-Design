## Summary

- Aims to use nature based solutions as a cheap option for decontaminating water

## Key Points

- It is estimated that between 4 and 5 million people currently reside in informal settlements in South Africa
- Residents in informal settlements have limited access to what is known as basic sanitation and water services, but these facilities are often limited, dysfunctional at best, and most often pose a health and safety risk
- Formal stormwater drainage systems are seldom provided, and this leaves residents with little choice other than to dispose their unwanted water in the vicinity of their dwellings resulting in the discharge of contaminated water into nearby rivers or wetlands without any treatment

## Further Questions

- How does the South African government intend to deal with informal settlers - is there interest in improving water quality?
