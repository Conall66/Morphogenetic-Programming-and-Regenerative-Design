[Urban Expansion Simulated by Integrated Cellular Automata and Agent-Based Models](https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/5/4/85)

## Summary

Used cellular automata model with Markov CA with 0.86% accuracy. 
## Key Findings

- In the research by Mustafa et al. [Patch-based logistic cellular automata](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516301211?casa_token=Z7OQcGDMSD0AAAAA:Dsqqqxnsn8UlLdLwuQ9tJO9KES4TgrVQi0GMVRjX5NhpkrcirAeIy7WfOH3ypbWEvMHI7TfM), they took advantage of multinominal logistic regression and CA to assess the probabilities of causative factors and neighbourhood effects in the urban expansion of Belgium
