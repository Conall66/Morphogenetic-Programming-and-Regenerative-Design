[Morphogenesis of Urban Water Distribution Networks: A Spatiotemporal Planning Approach for Cost-Efficient and Reliable Supply](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/9/708) (2018)
## Summary

- Evaluates existing and planned future water distribution networks (WDNs)
- Assesses step by step stress levels with anticipated demand/loss in different scenarios
- Highlights critical nodes
## Key Points

- Previous studies proved the high co-location between road and urban infrastructure networks, where about 80% of WDNs are located below 50% of the road networks (**we can assume then that most water ways are embedded below future road networks**)
