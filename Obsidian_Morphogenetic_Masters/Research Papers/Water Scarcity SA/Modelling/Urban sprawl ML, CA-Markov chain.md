[Analysis of urban sprawl dynamics using machine learning, CA-Markov chain, and the Shannon entropy model](https://environmentalsystemsresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40068-024-00348-5)

**MUST READ**
## Summary

The study investigates urban sprawl in Mbombela, South Africa, from 2003 to 2033, using machine learning, CA-Markov models, and Shannon entropy. It highlights significant land use changes: built-up areas and vegetation expanded, while water bodies and open land decreased. Techniques like Landsat imagery, SVM classification, and entropy analysis revealed the spatial-temporal patterns of urban growth. Predictive modelling shows further urban expansion by 2033. The findings emphasize sustainable urban planning to mitigate the environmental impacts of rapid urbanization, supporting policymaker decisions (ChatGPT)
## Key Points

- Used NASA geospatial imaging satellite to categorise morphology (LANDSAT) 
- Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will account for 50% of global population growth by 2050
- Improper urban land use planning has significantly impacted the loss of potentially productive agricultural land
- Machine learning models ([[Project Direction/Technical/Clue-S model]]) are more accurate than [[ABM of morphogenetic systems]] is a small scale study 
- SVM model separates support vectors into a hyperplane {...} The Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) outperformed the other two kernel types in performance and stability
- McNemar's test for evaluating maps against one another
- the SVM model exhibited an overall accuracy ranging from 96 to 99%
