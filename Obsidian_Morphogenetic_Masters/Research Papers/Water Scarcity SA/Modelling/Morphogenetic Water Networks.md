[Morphogenesis of Urban Water Distribution Networks: A Spatiotemporal Planning Approach for Cost-Efficient and Reliable Supply](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/9/708) (2018)
## Summary

- Evaluates existing and planned future water distribution networks (WDNs)
- Assesses step by step stress levels with anticipated demand/loss in different scenarios
- Highlights critical nodes
## Key Points

- Previous studies proved the high co-location between road and urban infrastructure networks, where about 80% of WDNs are located below 50% of the road networks (**we can assume then that most water ways are embedded below future road networks**)

### Methodology
![[Entropy Model Urban Water Netowrks.jpg | 400]]
## Limitations

- Does not explore implications on transport networks by optimising for water distributions and pipe sizing

## Software

- **Dynamind** - an open source software written in C++ and developed at the Unit for Environmental Engineering of the University of Innsbruck. The software contains (1) a spanning tree based algorithm for designing a minimal operating new network layout, (2) an algorithm to create a cyclic structure for the purpose of network reliability and (3) an automated pipe-sizing algorithm to create WDN based on geographic information system (GIS) data as input
- **EPANET2** - Simulates peak demand and low water usage for each node in the system
