## Summary
- This paper identified underlying rules in 3 different approaches to city expansion using AGM cellular automata
- Policies should not be guided by any one type of modelling!
## Key Information

- Modelling techniques operate in static - dynamic systems and real life constantly evolves
- First the model simulates local dynamics of movement of streets and buildings at small scale
- Second the model simulates large scale using agents to grow a system of cities
- Third the model generalises agents to cells
### Methodology

**Small scale local movement**

- All urban models can be written as a function of independent and dependent variables, input parameters and random errors

$Y_i^k = f\{Y_i, X_i, \Gamma_i, \epsilon_i^k\}$ - this model is missing the positive feedback mechanism of growth

- Instead, small scale growth can be categorised through an action/reaction term, a diffusion term and an error term





## Potential Future Development

- Converting policies into constraints for cellular automata models ("Currently the extent to which CA/CS and agent-based models of urban systems can be fully implemented for policy applications is quite limited")
- "But the biggest problem with all these models is their lack of parsimony. The richness of the data required makes calibration and estimation difficult and predictive accuracy hard to assess in terms of past simulations."
- "To what extent can formal models be built which will provide robust enough forecasts for real policy analysis?"
