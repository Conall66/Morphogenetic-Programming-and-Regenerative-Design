[A critical review of biomimetic building envelopes: towards a bio-adaptive model from nature to architecture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032122007328?via%3Dihub)

This paper compares adaptive bio-mimetic envelopes to conventional building envelopes, particularly with regards to thermal regulation. 
## Building Envelope
Sadinei defined the role of the building envelope as “the key factor that determines the quality and controls the indoor conditions irrespective of transient outdoor conditions”

### Critical Factors include:
- Thermal
- Visual
- Acoustic
- Durability
- Air Quality

### Approach to Assessing New Building Envelopes:

## Potential Spin-Out Idea

- Develop an AI capable of assessing different bio-materials for a particular building envelope [[Project Ideas]]
