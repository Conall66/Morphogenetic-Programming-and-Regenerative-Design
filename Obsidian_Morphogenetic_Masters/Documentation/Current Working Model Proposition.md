The aim of this project is to assess the state of water security for Cape Town going forward, and propose city growth models

- Use the road networks as an indicator for the water network expansion in Cape Town
- Model population growth and distribution to guide urban morphological expansion (applying masks)
- Use stochastic agent based model to project future expansion of water networks in Cape Town
- Assess then the prevalence of communities and integral nodes
- Given this new network of waterways, identify the set of critical nodes for which investment into repairs would have a greater benefit than investment into new aquifers, desalination plants etc.
