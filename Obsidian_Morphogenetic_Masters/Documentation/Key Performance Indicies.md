## Must
1. **Solution demonstrates the future state of water scarcity for Cape Town with a consideration for the population density**
2. **Solution incorporates behavioural patterns for different morphologies to X accuracy**
	1. Consider the stochastic nature of agent based modelling and Markov chains to generate probabilistic outcomes (interval predictions)
	2. Consider the minimum viable accuracy to enact policy change in South Africa
3. **Solution suggests appropriate action to tackle any identified problems surrounding water scarcity, recognising feasible and less feasible interventions**
4. **Solution is easily interpretable**
5. **Solution is divided into test and validation sets to verify model accuracy**
6. **Solution can not be underwritten by any existing work, and is categorically novel**
## Should
1. **Solution is scalable to X degree**
	1. Incorporating different classes of morphology (fringe settlements and dense urban landscapes) is so that we can apply these same models elsewhere
2. **Solution is validated by those that have the capacity to implement change
3. **Solution can be run by any body who might wat
