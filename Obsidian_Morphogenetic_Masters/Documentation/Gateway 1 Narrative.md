## Introduction

- Discuss rising population in Southern Africa
- Discuss impact on access to sanitised water
- Talk about existing water infrastructure failures
- Discuss mechanisms behind city expansion

- Highlight why it will be important to outline demand for sanitised water in the future, with emphasis on smart city construction planning (policy reformation?). Talk about the lack of correspondence between water companies and urban planners.

## Morphogenetic Programming

- Break down the meaning of morphogenesis and urban sprawl
- Highlight the importance of modelling urban sprawl, and how growth mechanisms vary based on size (densification vs rapid expansion)
- Outline findings of existing research
	- [[Urban sprawl dynamics using ML, CA-Markov chain, and the Shannon entropy model]]
	- [[Forces shaping urban morphology in Southern Africa Today]]
	- [[The trajectories of urbanisation in Southern Africa]]
	- [[Pathways to Transformative Adaptation in South African Cities]]
	- [[Agents cells and cities]]
	- [[Bridging the gap between urban morphology and urban modelling]]

## Methodology

- An evaluation of approaches cellular automata (Markov - CA), machine learning, reinforcement learning, agent based modelling and flow modelling (highlight advantages in table structure?)
