## Introduction

- Discuss rising population in Southern Africa
- Discuss impact on access to sanitised water
- Talk about existing water infrastructure failures
- Discuss mechanisms behind city expansion

## Morphogenetic Programming

- Break down the meaning of morphogenesis and urban sprawl
- Highlight the importance of modelling urban sprawl, and how growth mechanisms vary based on size (densification vs rapid expansion)
- Outline findings of existing research
	- [[Urban sprawl dynamics using ML, CA-Markov chain, and the Shannon entropy model]]
	- [[Forces shaping urban morphology in Southern Africa Today]]
	- 

## Methodology
