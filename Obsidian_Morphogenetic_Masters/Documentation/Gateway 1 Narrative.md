## Problem Contextualisation

1. What is happening worldwide with urbanisation
2. How is it changing, and where is it changing most rapidly
3. What does this mean for major infrastructure, resource strain etc.
4. Choose one particular country (South Africa) as a case study
5. Discuss the problem of urbanisation in South Africa
6. Discuss how fringe settlements expand
7. What does this mean for fresh water supplies?
8. City planners are not working in conjunction with water infrastructure planners
9. Aim to inform policy changes (give example of where these models have previously influenced growth mechanisms)
10. Outline project proposal - building morphogenetic growth patterns of built environment
## Morphogenetic Programming

- Break down the meaning of morphogenesis and urban sprawl
- Highlight the importance of modelling urban sprawl, and how growth mechanisms vary based on size (densification vs rapid expansion)
- Outline findings of existing research
	- [[Urban sprawl dynamics using ML, CA-Markov chain, and the Shannon entropy model]]
	- [[Forces shaping urban morphology in Southern Africa Today]]
	- [[The trajectories of urbanisation in Southern Africa]]
	- [[Pathways to Transformative Adaptation in South African Cities]]
	- [[Agents cells and cities]]
	- [[Bridging the gap between urban morphology and urban modelling]]

## Methodology

- An evaluation of approaches cellular automata (Markov - CA), machine learning, reinforcement learning, agent based modelling and flow modelling (highlight advantages in table structure?)
