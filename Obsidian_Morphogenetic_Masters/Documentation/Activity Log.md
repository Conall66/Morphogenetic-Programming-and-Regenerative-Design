| 05/11 | Research into limitation in and around the development and widespread implementation of bio materials, how important it is to model these materials, whether they have applications in the construction or other industries, how accessible for masters project                                                                               | Very few living bio materials seem to have applications besides mycelium insulation and bacterial concrete. Engineered living materials can be leveraged in adaptive building envelopes (cooling, airflow, air quality etc.). Revisited morphogenetic programming software demonstrations to ideate with other directions. | Assess the potential for mycelium  insulation, bacterial concrete and other engineered living materials further. Move on to FSPMs in BIM software and influencing morphogenetic/biomimetic architectural design |
| 06/11 | Further research into mycelium insulation, bacterial concrete and other ELMs before moving onto other research. Explore other areas of interest around morphogenetic programming. Investigate urban city planning and systems optimisation centred around morphogenetic growth patterns. Identify potential key stakeholders to reach out to. | Research conducted in urban morphogenesis in smart city design, deep dive into approaches to morphogenetic programming, further research into adaptive bacterial concrete, Obsidian rearrangement.                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
